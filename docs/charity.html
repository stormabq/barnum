United Nations Pilgrimage for Youth
We in Odd Fellowship are proud of the opportunity we give students who have completed their sophomore or junior year of high school. Groups of selected students are transported to New York where they have the opportunity to learn about the work the United Nations is doing to promote world peace, to educate the people of the world, and to relieve their suffering whether by famine, disease, or war. Students enjoy a question and answer period that sharpens their comprehension of United Nations affairs. That is but a small part of the learning experience for those selected to participate. The students are taken to many historical places and have a first hand view of their country’s beginning and of the Civil War. They visit many of the cultural and educational centers of the nation. Coming as they do from all areas of the United States and several foreign countries, they exchange views of education, politics, religion, world relationships and cultures. This learning and growing experience provided by Odd Fellows and Rebekahs is one of the most important and effective programs that we have. Approximately 42,000 students have participated in the United Nations Pilgrimage. No other organization is accorded this privilege

<p>Community Service &amp; Living Legacy
Instituted in 1989 with the goal of planting trees to beautify the environment and improve our ecology.  &quot; Plant a tree for those who come after me&quot;.  Many lodges have participated with their city Parks or Recreation Departments of School districts to plant trees in many areas where shade and environmental improvements would be appreciated.  Often Lodges plant trees in honor of members who have passed away.

<p>IOOF SOS Children's Village
Several years ago, recognizing a need to care for orphaned, abandoned, neglected, and abused children, a non-governmental child welfare organization was formed which is now known as the SOS Children’s Villages and provides loving, stable homes in over 132 countries around the world. They serve all children in need regardless of race, nationality or creed. Every child is assured of the love and support of a surrogate parent with brothers and sisters, the opportunity to live in a permanent house, and the positive experience of being part of a larger village community. This prepares them to take their rightful place in society as happy, responsible, and productive adults.
That is precisely what the Independent Order of Odd Fellows did when our children’s homes were operating all over this country for more than a century. At one time the Odd Fellows and Rebekahs had 65 children’s homes in the U.S. and were caring for over 100,000 children. The SOS Village Organization at this time has 456 Villages serving over 58,000 children.</p>
<p>A partnership between the I.O.O.F. and The SOS Children’s Villages will be an ideal relationship between the two most dedicated, private, non-governmental, non-profit organizations in the world who are dedicated to protecting and nurturing orphans and all children in need. There are currently three SOS Villages in the United States and The I.O.O.F. is in the process of building a SOS Village in Cambodia which is planned for dedication in 2006.</p>
