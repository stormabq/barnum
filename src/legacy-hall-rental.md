Hall Rental Rates

Located in the heart of Downtown Corvallis, our facilities are offered at friendly rates because we ask our renters to take full responsibility of the duties for set-up, tear down and cleaning of their events. The South Ballroom with it's beautiful brick and west facing wall of windows is ready for any large event or dance party. Our North Hall has a complete kitchen and ADA accessible bathroom. Both halls have projection screens and beautiful wood floors. From corporate conferences to birthday dance parties, we are ready to help you have a great event. Below is a minimum list of cleaning responsibilities. You may only use enclosed candles, no open flame is allowed. We welcome your choice of caterers and for events choosing to have bar service, beer, wine and cider products may be served. Any alcohol must be served by a licensed OLCC staff provided by your caterer or by our facility for an extra fee. Please see below for further details on our catering and alcohol policy.

We offer a non-profit rate to those organizations who have 501(c)3 status. Those rates are listed below. We also offer a 'continual' use rate to those who would like to teach a class or series of workshops. Please call or email for details and space availability.

No food or drink are allowed anywhere on the Property without prior approval by facility. Should your public event include serving of any alcoholic beverages (beer/wine/cider only) you must obtain an alcohol serving permit from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission. You must also hire OLCC licensed staff to manager the bar area. If you cannot obtain an OLCC server they will be provided for you at additional staffing fee. The serving permit, the Servers permit and proof of alcohol indemnity insurance must be submitted to the Business Manager 5 days prior to your event.  If you provide your own alcohol, an OLCC licensed server must manage your service and will be provided for you for an extra staffing fee. Self-service of alcohol is prohibited. Once the bar area is closed, no alcohol will be served. Distilled spirits are not permitted, beer, wine and cider are the only alcohol beverages permitted on the property.  If you are using a licensed caterer all these items should be provided for and managed by the caterer. If any of these policies are violated the event manager reserves the right to close your event at any time and no refund will be entitled to the customer.
